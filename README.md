2. Insert the SK into a USB port.  
3. Turn on the computer.

## A Few Ways to Help & Info on Proceeds  

The SovereignKey is a passion project, and I sincerely thank you for your interest and support in helping make it a reality.  

Since discovering Bitcoin in 2019/2020, I have been driven to make a meaningful contribution to its growth and adoption. I truly believe that self-custodial ownership and the responsible use of our data and value are critical to personal sovereignty. We must strive to reduce what is leaked to big or small tech, wherever we can control it.  

This vision, combined with a burning desire to get cutting-edge technology into the hands of those who need it most, has led me to create the SovereignKey. This is my contribution to the Bitcoin ecosystem and the ongoing fight for digital sovereignty.
