# SovereignKey (#SK) 

The #SK is a collection of free & open-source (FOSS) tools that enhances your control & privacy in the digital realm. It achieves this by transforming any computer it is plugged into, and booted from, into a secure & self-managed device for almost all your security focused computer needs, including the management of your Bitcoin interactions via an arry of options using the Tor network.

Why create the SovereignKey? 

Because there are multiple ways to bring about liberation & the emancipation of information. Doing so while subsequently enabling the usage of tools in a manner that keeps you safe & private, is one such method I wanted to explore. I wanted to see the SK exist because I wanted to solve the problem of effectvley putting the future in the hands of those who will live in it. 

SK is the ideal solution for managing your digital value privately & securely, yet still affordably.

## Features

Encased within an ordinary USB drive (varrying GB options to come), it offers discreet security & seamless integration as it boots from an Operating System (OS) know to focus on user sovereignty & the utilization of battle-tested FOSS privacy tools. 

It does not require any prior special knowledge of how all the tools it is made up of work, beyond this ReadMe file, to get started with the SK. However, you will find links to all the different resources used to bring this about further down in this ReadMe. 

We highly recommend that you DYOR (`Do Your Own Research`) on these and familiarise yourself with them.

## Installation Steps

In order to use the SK, you will have to put the computer you are attaching it to into Boot Mode & then choose to `Boot from the USB/External USB` instead of the `Internal Hard Disk`. This will effectively allow you to use the computer you have plugged the SK into as your own computer. 

Why? Because you are now booting up from the `Operating System` (OS) that is on the SK.

Please Note: Some devices require that you tap the `Boot Menu Key` repatadly as the device boots up in order to access the `Boot Menu` instead of only pressing it once or holding it down.

## Technologies Used

Accessible Computing is the goal of the #SK - Many individuals need access to a computer but do not have the funds to purchase one, or to upgrade to newer models. Others, need a way to ensure the work they are doing is as private as possible without having to worry about the underlying privacy of the device they are using.

By bringing technologies & information that have already been open sourced together in order to create a "Swiss Army Knife" type Soverign Solution, we have essentially found a way to export these tools in one product to the masses across the globe, at affordable rates.

## A few ways to help & info on proceeds

This is a passion project first & foremost, so I thank you all for your interest in the SovereignKey & how to go about assisting us in continuing to make it a reality.

Since "getting into" Bitcoin back in 2019/2020, I have always wanted to find a way to make a meaningful contribution to its advancement in some way, shape or form. I truly belive the self-custodial ownership & usage of our data & value is the key to our kingdoms & that there is a lot more we can do to ensure there is as little, within our control, being leaked to big or small tech. 

That combined with the burining desire to ensure we can actually get technogoly in the hands of those who need it the most in this current & coming age of tech dominiation, has led me to the #SK, which is my contribution by way of working to be a prudent student, in a time where everyone wants to be the reviered puzzle master.

A portion of all sales will therefore be donated to all of the contributors to the FOSS components of the #SK listed under `Knowledge Transfer` above. However, if you feel moved to, please consider donatiing directly to them.

## Warnings/Known Issues
