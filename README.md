## Installation Steps

In order to use the SK, you will have to put the computer you are attaching it to into Boot Mode & then choose to `Boot from the USB/External USB` instead of the `Internal Hard Disk`. This will effectively allow you to use the computer you have plugged the SK into as your own computer. Why? Because you are now booting up from the `Operating System` (OS) that is on the SK.

Please Note: Some devices require that you tap the `Boot Menu Key` repatadly as the device boots up in order to access the `Boot Menu` instead of only pressing it once or holding it down.

You can contribute to either, or both the, Easy Books & Easy Education, both described in the following section about Technologies Used.

## Technologies Used

In this section, we can list down technologies or modules which we used while building the project to help others understand the creation components in a better manner.

Accessible Computing is the goal of the #SoverignKey - Many individuals need access to a computer but do not have the funds to purchase one or to upgrade to newer models. Others need a way to ensure the work they are doing is as private as possible without having to worry about the underlying privacy of the device they are using.

By bringing technologies & information that have already been open sourced together in order to create a "Swiss Army Knife" type Soverign Solution, we have essentially found a way to export these tools in one product to the masses across the globe.
