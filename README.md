## Installation Steps

In order to use the SK, you will have to put the computer you are attaching it to into Boot Mode & then choose to `Boot from the USB/External USB` instead of the `Internal Hard Disk`. This will effectively allow you to use the computer you have plugged the SK into as your own computer. 

Why? Because you are now booting up from the `Operating System` (OS) that is on the SK.

Please Note: Some devices require that you tap the `Boot Menu Key` repatadly as the device boots up in order to access the `Boot Menu` instead of only pressing it once or holding it down.

## Technologies Used

Accessible Computing is the goal of the #SK - Many individuals need access to a computer but do not have the funds to purchase one or to upgrade to newer models. Others need a way to ensure the work they are doing is as private as possible without having to worry about the underlying privacy of the device they are using.

By bringing technologies & information that have already been open sourced together in order to create a "Swiss Army Knife" type Soverign Solution, we have essentially found a way to export these tools in one product to the masses across the globe.

## A few ways to help & info on proceeds

This is a passion project first & foremost, so I thank you all for your interest in the #SK & how to go about assisting us in continuing to make it a reality.

Since "getting into" Bitcoin back in 2019/2020, I have always wanted to find a way to make a meaningful contribution to its advancement in some way, shape or form. I truly belive the self-custodial ownership & usage of our data & value is the key to our kingdoms & that there is a lot more we can do to ensure there is as little, within our control, being leaked to big or small tech. 

That combined with the burining desire to ensure we can actually get technogoly in the hands of those who need it the most in this current & coming age of tech dominiation, has led me to the #SK, which is my contribution by way of working to be a prudent student, in a time where everyone wants to be the reviered puzzle master.

A portion of all sales will therefore be donated to all of the contributors to the FOSS components of the #SK listed under `Knowledge Transfer` above.
